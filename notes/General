I took houses out just for a brief time...that code in therre
is a trainwreck, especially for do_house which handles the
building of the house, selling, listing, etc. I'm gonna write
it from scratch tomorrow.
 
Peace

Subject Copyover~
Text
Oh yeah, I remembered later that I hadn't rebooted the
mud with copyover to ensure that there's no problematic
rom executable and potential crashes.
 
Thanks and I've already started rewriting the player homes.
